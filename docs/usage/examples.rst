Alignment Diagram
-----------------

The alignment diagram draws alignments between a reference sequence (drawn in red), and query sequence. Each query sequence is represented by a line underneath the reference sequence, with the alignment drawn as a box aligned to the reference sequence.

Contig Alignment Diagram
------------------------

For each query contig, the Contig Alignment Diagram draws the most prominent alignments inside a rectange representing the query contig. The alignments are colour coded by reference contig, and shaded to give an indication of the position in the reference, and the orientation of the alignment.

Coverage Map Diagram
--------------------

Alignments are binned based on their position in the reference contigs. For each reference contig a heatmap image is produced showing the coverage. These are arranged in a tex file.
